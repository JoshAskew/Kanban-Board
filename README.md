## Description
This Kanban board is a visual tool that helps teams manage tasks and workflows by organizing them into columns that represent different stages of a process (like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done"). Each task is displayed on a card, which moves across the columns as it progresses. This layout provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of work status, helping teams see whatâ€™s being worked on, identify bottlenecks, and keep workflows efficient.
